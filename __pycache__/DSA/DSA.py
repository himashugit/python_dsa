DSA is a diff way to organize your data on system to use efficiently4

Queue DS - Organize in FIFO
Stack DS - In an order like bookshelf

ALgorithm in Computer - Set of rules for a computer prog to accomplish a task
Data input > Calculate > Stop when process

Shortest path algo use to find a shortest path in google map
what amkes a good algo.
Efficiency
correctness

Types of DS
1. Primitive
2. Non Primitive

1. Primitive DS - Integer, float, char, string, boolena
2. Non primitive
2a) Linear - static - Array - fix mem loc
  Dynamic - Linked List, stack, queue

  Non Linear - Graph & Tree

Types of algo -
1. Simple Recursive
2. Divinde & conquer - Divide the problem into subproblem of the same type and solve these subprob recursively
combine the solution to subproblems into a sol'n to the original prob
3. Dynamice programming - worked based on memorization
- to find the best sol'n
4. Greedy algo - We take the best we can without worrying baout the future consequences
- We hope that choosing a optimum soln at each step we will end up at a global optimum soln
5. Brute force  - try all possiblity untill found satisfactory sol'n
6. Randomized - use a random number atleast once during the computation to make a decision
